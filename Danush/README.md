**COMPLETED :**

Sequential Flow of Items

**Known bugs :**
UI designed by seeing a monitor, so it may overlap contents in smaller screens.

Ingredient level is not monitored after the consumption but monitoored when we manually change it.

Not handled force poweroff and unexpected events during other process.

**TODO :**

Modularize the code

Use async/await to avoid nesting of settimeout()
