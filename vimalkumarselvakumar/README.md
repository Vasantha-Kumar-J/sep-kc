# Task Scheduler

- I have created general structure of the project with Interfaces.
- I completed import and export tasks which will export the given list to a json file.

- I have completed employee management task where you can add any number of emplyees.

- I have started scheduling task
    - FilterEmployees: will filter the list of emplyees based on the skill sets required by the task.
    - It also sort them based on the number of skills they have, so that the employees with small number of skills will get asigned to the project first.

# Yet to do:
 - After filtering I have to assign the employees to the task they are in and make their availability as 0`(represents no)`.
